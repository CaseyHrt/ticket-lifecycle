# osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution

This tutorial delineates the lifecycle of a ticket within osTicket, a help desk ticketing system. It assumes prior completion of both the Prerequisites and Installation lab and the Post-Installation Configuration lab.

## Environments and Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)**: Cloud computing service for hosting osTicket.
- **Remote Desktop**: Used to access and manage the virtual machines or compute instances.
- **Internet Information Services (IIS)**: Web server for hosting osTicket.
- **osTicket**: Open-source help desk ticketing system.
- **Operating System: Windows 10 (21H2)**: Environment for hosting and managing osTicket.

## Ticket Lifecycle Stages
1. **Intake**: Creation of a ticket by users through the osTicket Support Center site.
2. **Assignment and Communication**: Tickets are assigned to agents for resolution, and communication between agents and end-users occurs through the ticket thread.
3. **Working the Issue**: Agents adjust ticket settings, communicate updates, and work towards resolving the issue.
4. **Resolution**: Agents post solutions, close the ticket, and move it to the 'Closed Ticket' queue for archiving.

## Intake
- To create a ticket, users navigate to the osTicket Support Center site and complete the form, specifying a 'Help Topic' and providing an 'Issue Summary' along with any necessary files or screenshots.

## Assignment and Communication
- After creation, tickets are sent to the Agents' queue for resolution. Agents adjust ticket settings such as status, priority, and assigned personnel based on the issue's severity or impact. Communication with end-users or other agents occurs through the ticket thread, allowing updates on the ticket's status.

## Working the Issue
- Agents work on resolving the ticket's issue, making necessary adjustments and updates within the ticket thread. Changes made to the ticket are reflected in the 'Ticket Thread', facilitating collaboration and tracking of progress towards resolution.

## Resolution
- Upon finding a solution, agents post a reply in the ticket thread to notify the user. Subsequently, the ticket is marked as resolved and closed. Resolved tickets are archived in the 'Closed Ticket' queue for reference.
